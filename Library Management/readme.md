#### Library Management System

I have created a library management system after being inspired from many people.I have used Java and JavaFx  for basic structure building.
The scene builder was actually used for the front end purpose.I have used the various libraries like GSON,BootStrap,debry etc.

You basically have to login in to it .Below you can see some of the screen shots
